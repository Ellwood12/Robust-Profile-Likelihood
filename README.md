# Robust Profile Likelihood (RPG) for Robust Optimal Design

This repository contains the code and data used to generate **Robustness Profile Graphics (RPGs)** for analyzing optimal and robust experimental designs. The RPG provides insight into the contribution of individual design points to overall design efficiency, allowing for a more detailed assessment of design robustness under potential data loss.

The study extends previous methods by using **particle swarm optimization** to generate robust designs, and visualizes them at both the overall and observation levels.
