# Robust Profile Likelihood (RPG) for Robust Optimal Design

This repository contains the code and datasets used to generate Robustness Profile Graphics (RPGs) for analyzing optimal and robust experimental designs. The RPG provides insight into the contribution of individual design points to overall design efficiency, allowing for a more detailed assessment of design robustness under potential data loss.
